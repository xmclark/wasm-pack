# Changelog

## üåÑ 0.5.1

- ### ü§ï Fixes

  - **Child Process and output management - [fitzgen], [issue/287] [pull/392]**

    Not exactly a "fix", but definitely a huge improvment in how child processes and their
    output are handled by `wasm-pack`. Ever sat at a long prompt from `wasm-pack` and
    wondered what was happening? No longer! Did `wasm-pack` eat your test output- no more!

  - **Less scary missing field  messages - [mstallmo], [issue/393] [pull/394]**

    After watching a livestream of someone using `wasm-pack`, [fitzgen] noted that folks
    seemed pretty alarmed by the loud warning about missing optional manifest fields.
    As a result, we are now downgrading those messages from WARN to INFO, and consolidating
    them on a single line.

  - **Remove lingering forced nightly usage - [alexcrichton], [pull/383]**

    In 0.5.0 we removed all forced nightly usage as we depend on `~1.30` which is now
    available on both nightly and beta channels! We had a bit of a race condition with 
    that PR and the `wasm-pack test` PR, and missed a few as a result! This removes all
    lingering forced nightly, which only affected the `wasm-pack test` command.

  - **Fix `wasm-bindgen-test` dependency error message - [fitzgen], [issue/377] [pull/378]**

    The error message about missing the `wasm-bindgen-test` dependency errantly stated
    that the user was missing a `wasm-bindgen` dependency! We've fixed it to correctly
    state the missing dependency now.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è 0.5.0

- ### ‚ú® Features

  - #### **Website!** - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/246]

    We have a website now. It has the installer and links to documentation. In the future,
    we hope to have calls to action for folks first coming to the site who are looking to
    do specific things- these will help them find the docs and tutorials they need to.

    This PR also has a complete rework of our documentation.

    Check it out [here](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/)!

  - #### üç± Module Support

    - **BREAKING: use correct `package.json` keys for generated JavaScript - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/309] [pull/312]**

      This is marked as potentially breaking because it changes the `package.json` keys that
      are generated by the project.

      Previously, we generated a JavaScript file and placed it in the `main` key, regardless
      of what you were targeting, ES6 and Node.js alike. 

      We have received a lot of requests for `wasm-pack` to generate "isomorphic" packages,
      that contain assets that could work on both Node.js and ES6, and this led to us 
      looking more closely at how we are using `package.json`.

      With this release, we will do the following:

      - `--target browser`: By default, we generate JS that is an ES6 module. We used to put
        this in the `main` field. Now we put it in the `module` field. We also add 
        `sideEffects: false` so that bundlers that want to tree shake can.

      - `--target nodejs`: This target doesn't change. We put generated JS that is a
        CommonJS module in the `main` key.

      - `--target no-modules`: This is a new target. For this target we generate bare JavaScript.
        This code is put in a `browser` field.

      You can see the structs that represent each target's expected `package.json` [here](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/tree/master/src/manifest/npm).

      Thanks so much to [bterlson] for his help in sorting this out for us!

  - #### üõ†Ô∏è New Commands

    - **`wasm-pack init` is now `wasm-pack build` - [csmoe], [issue/188] [pull/216]**

      When this project was first conceived, we imagined it would be simply a way to package
      up generate wasm and js and publish it to npm. Here we are at version `0.5.0` and we
      have become much more- an integrated build tool!

      As a result, the original command `init` does a lot more than that these days. We've
      renamed the command to better reflect the work it's actually doing. `init` will still
      work, but is deprecated now, and we will eventually remove it.

      [pull/216]: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/pull/216

    - **add new command: `wasm-pack test` - [fitzgen], [pull/271]**

      This is an experimental new command that will run your tests in Node.js or a headless
      browser using `wasm-pack test`. Check out this [tutorial](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/wasm-bindgen-test/index.html)
      to learn more!

    - **add 2FA support to `wasm-pack publish` - [mstallmo], [issue/257] [pull/282]**

      We've been wrapping the `npm login` and `npm publish` commands as `wasm-pack login`
      and `wasm-pack publish` for a while now- but we didn't fully support two factor
      authentication. Now we do! (Be safe out there! 2FA is good for everyone!)

      [pull/282]: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/pull/282

  - #### üéè New Flags

    - **New target, bare JavaScript: `--target no-modules`  - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/317] [pull/327]**

      `wasm-bindgen` offers a `no-modules` flag that until now, we didn't support. This flag
      produces bare, no modules JavaScript. So if that's your thing, this target is for you!

      [issue/317]: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/issues/317
      [pull/327]: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/pull/327

    - **`--access` flag for `wasm-pack` publish - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/297] [pull/299]**

      Many of our tutorials use scopes to help prevent folks from attempting to publish 
      packages that will lead to npm Registry errors because the package name already exists.

      However, by default, scoped packages are assumed by the npm registry to be private, and
      the ability to publish private packages to the npm registry is a paid feature. Worry not!
      Now you can pass `--access public` to `wasm-pack publish` and publish scoped packages
      publicly.

  - #### ‚úÖ New Checks
    
    - **rustc version check - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/351] [pull/353]**

      Now that we have a new fangled installer, there's a chance that folks might install `wasm-pack`
      and not have Rust installed. Additionally, now that the features we required from the `nightly`
      channel of Rust have moved to `beta`- we don't need to enforce `nightly`.

      As of this release, we will check that your Rust version is above `1.30.0`. You can be on
      either the `nightly` or `beta` channel and all of `wasm-pack`s calls to `cargo` will
      respect that.

      Really hate this? You can pass `--mode force` to `wasm-pack` to skip this check. I hope you know
      what you're doing!

    - **coordinating wasm-bindgen versions and installing from binaries for improved speed - [datapup], [issue/146] [pull/244] [pull/324]**

      This is the true gem of this release. Have you been frustrated by how long `wasm-pack` takes to
      run? Overusing `--mode no-install`? This is the release you're looking for.

      Many releases back we realized that folks were struggling to keep the `wasm-bindgen` library
      that their project used in sync with the `wasm-bindgen` CLI application which `wasm-pack`
      runs for you. This became such an issue that we opted to force install `wasm-bindgen` to ensure
      that every `wasm-pack` user had the latest version.

      Like many technical solutions, this solved our original problem, but caused a new one. Now, we
      we are forcing a `cargo install` of `wasm-bindgen` on every run, and that means downloading
      and compiling `wasm-bindgen` everytime you want to run `wasm-pack`. That's unacceptable!

      We're happy to announce that we have a pretty great solution, and several more planned for
      future releases. As of this release, we will read your `Cargo.lock` to find the version of
      `wasm-bindgen` you are using in your local project. We will attempt to fetch a binary version
      of `wasm-bindgen` that matches your local version. We place that binary local to your project,
      and use it when you run `wasm-pack build`. The next time you run `wasm-pack build` we'll use
      that binary, instead of fetching a new one. We still fall back to `cargo install` for
      less common architectures but this is a huge speed improvement. Check out these benchmarks!

    - **enforce `cargo build` with `--lib` - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/303] [pull/330]**

      Right now, `wasm-pack` only works on Rust library projects. But sometimes, if you're
      new to Rust, you might end up having a `main.rs` in your project, just by mistake.
      Some folks ran into this and realized that it can cause issues!

      As a result, we are enforcing that `cargo build` only build the library at this time.

      Want to use `wasm-pack` on a binary application? We're interested in hearing from you!
      Checkout [issue/326] and please comment! We want to support binary applicaitons in
      the future and are always happy and curious to hear about how folks use `wasm-pack`!

  - #### Installers and Releases

    - **Appveyor Windows Pre-Built binaries - [alexcrichton], [issue/147] [pull/301]**

      We finally got Appveyor to publish pre-built binaries to GitHub releases.
      Aside: I really wish there were an easier way to test and debug this stuff.

    - **new experimental installer - [alexcrichton], [pull/307]**

      Whew, this one is exciting. Up until now, `wasm-pack` has been distributed using
      `cargo install`. This is not ideal for several reasons. Updating is confusing,
      and every time it's installed the user has to wait for it to compile- right at the
      moment they just want to hurry up and use it already.

      Say hello to the new `wasm-pack` installer- we have an executable for Windows
      and a `curl` script for *nix users. Not pleased with that? File an issue for your
      preferred distribution method and we'll do our best to get it working!

      This is experimental- so please try it out and file issues as you run into things!
      You'll always be able to use `cargo install` as a backup.

- #### ü§ï Fixes

  - **recognize `[dependencies.wasm-bindgen]` during dep check in `init` - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/221] [pull/224]**

    When we originally implemented the dependency check in `wasm-pack init` we naively only checked for the
    "simple" dependency declaration, `[dependencies] wasm-bindgen="0.2"`. However! This is not the only way
    to declare this dependency, and it's not the ideal way to do it if you want to specify features from the
    crate. Now that a bunch of folks want to use `features = ["serde-serialize"]` we ran into a bunch of folks
    having issues with our naive dependency checker! Thanks so much to [turboladen] for filing the very detailed
    issue that helped us solve this quickly!

    PSSSST! Curious what `features = ["serde-serialize"]` with `wasm-bindgen` actually does? It's awesome:

    > It's possible to pass data from Rust to JS not explicitly supported in the [Feature Reference](./feature-reference.md) by serializing via [Serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde).

  - **improve UX of publish and pack commands - [Mackiovello], [pull/198]**

    Previous to this fix, you would need to be in the parent directory of the `/pkg` dir to successfully run
    `pack` or `publish`. This was pretty crummy! Thankfully, [Mackiovello] swooped in with a fix, that you can
    find documented in the [pack and publish docs]!

  - **use `PathBuf` instead of `String` for paths - [Mackiovello], [pull/220]**

    This is mostly a maintenance PR  but does fix one very small bug- depending on if you add a trailing slash to
    a path that you pass to `init`, you might have seen an extra `/`! Now that we're using a proper Type to
    handle this, that's much better, and in general, all the operations using paths are more robust now.

- #### ü§ï Fixes

  - **fix `files` key value for projects build for `nodejs` target - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/199] [pull/205]**

    We became aware that the `files` key in `package.json` did not include the additional `_bg.js` file that 
    `wasm-bindgen` generates for projects being built for the `nodejs` target. This resulted in the file not
    being included in the published package and resulted in a `Module Not Found` error for folks.

    This was a group effort from [mciantyre] with [pull/200] and [Brooooooklyn] with [pull/197]. Thank you so

## üåü 0.4.0

This release has a ton of awesome things in it, but the best thing is that
almost all of this awesome work is brought to you by a **new** contributor
to `wasm-pack`. Welcome ya'll! We're so glad to have you!

### ‚ú® Features

- #### üéè New Flags

  - **`--mode` flag for skipping steps when calling `init` - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/186]** 

      After teaching and working with `wasm-pack` for some time, it's clear that people would
      like the flexibility to run some of the steps included in the `init` command and not others.
      This release introduces a `--mode` flag that you can pass to `init`. The two modes currently
      available are `skip-build` and `no-installs` and they are explained below. In the future, 
      we are looking to change the `init` interface, and potentially to split it into two commands.
      If you have thoughts or opinions on this, please weigh in on [issue/188]!

    - **`skip-build` mode - [kohensu], [pull/151]**

      ```
      wasm-pack init --mode skip-build
      ```

      Sometimes you want to run some of the shorter meta-data steps that
      `wasm-pack init` does for you without all the longer build steps. Now
      you can! Additionally, this PR was a fantastic refactor that allows even
      more custom build configurations will be simple to implement!

      wasm-pack init --mode no-installs
      ```

      Sometimes you want to run `wasm-pack` and not have it modify your global
      env by installing stuff! Or maybe you are just in a hurry and trust your
      env is set up correctly- now the `--mode no-install` option allows you to
      do this.

  - **`--debug`  - [clanehin], [pull/127]**

    ```
    wasm-pack init --debug
    ```

    Find yourself needing to compile your Rust in `development` mode? You can now
    pass the `--debug` flag to do so! Thanks so much to [clanehin] for filing 
    [issue/126] for this feature... and then implementing it!

- #### ‚úÖ New Checks

  - **ensure you have `cdylib` crate type - [kendromelon], [pull/150]**

    One of the biggest mistakes we've seen beginners make is forgetting to declare
    the `cdylib` crate type in their `Cargo.toml` before running `wasm-pack init`.
    This PR fixes that, and comes from someone who ran into this exact issue learning
    about `wasm-pack` at [JSConfEU]! Love when it works out like this.

  - **ensure you have declared wasm-bindgen as a dep - [robertohuertasm], [pull/162]**

    Another easy mistake to make is to forget to declare `wasm-bindgen` as a
    dependency in your `Cargo.toml`. Now `wasm-pack` will check and make sure you
    have it set before doing a bunch of long build steps :)

  - **ensure you are running `nightly` - [FreeMasen], [pull/172]**

    `wasm-pack` currently requires that you run it with `nightly` Rust. Now, `wasm-pack`
    will make sure you have `nightly` installed and will ensure that `cargo build` is run
    with `nightly`. Thanks so much to [FreeMasen] for filing [issue/171] and fixing it!

### ü§ï Fixes

- **fixed broken progress bar spinner - [migerh], [pull/164]**

  Oh no! We broke the progress bar spinner in version 0.3.0. Thankfully, it's
  fixed now- with a thoughtful refactor that also makes the underlying code
  sounder overall.

[pull/164]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/164

### üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

- **WIP bot - [ashleygwilliams] & [mgattozzi], [issue/170]**

  We've got a lot of work happening on `wasm-pack` so it's good to have a bit
  of protection from accidentally merging a Work In Progress. As a result, we
  now have the [WIP Github App] set up on `wasm-pack`. Great suggestion [mgattozzi]!

  [WIP Github App]: https://github.com/wip/app
  [issue/170]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/issues/170

- **modularize `command.rs` - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/182]**

  Thanks to the growth of `wasm-pack`, `command.rs` was getting pretty long.
  We've broken it out into per command modules now, to help make it easier to
  read and maintain!

  [pull/182]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/182

- **improve PoisonError conversion - [migerh], [pull/187]**

  As part of the awesome progress bar spinner fix in [pull/164], [migerh] introduced
  a small concern with an `unwrap` due to an outstanding need to convert `PoisonError`
  into `wasm-pack`'s custom `Error`. Though not a critical concern, [migerh] mitigated
  this right away by replacing `std::sync::RwLock` with the [`parking_lot` crate]!
  This cleaned up the code even more than the previous patch!

- **wasm category for crates.io discovery- [TomasHubelbauer], [pull/149]**

  [crates.io] has [categories] to help folks discover crates, be we weren't
  leveraging it! Now- if you explore the [`wasm` category] on [crates.io]
  you'll see `wasm-pack`!

### üìñ Documentation

- **cleaned up the README - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/155]**

  Our `README` was struggling with a common problem- doing too much at once.
  More specifically, it wasn't clear who the audience was, contributers or 
  end users? We've cleaned up our README and created a document specifically
  to help contributors get up and running.

## üå† 0.3.1

Babby's first point release! Are we a real project now?

### ü§ï Fixes 

- **fixed `init` `Is a Directory` error - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/139]**

  Our new logging feature accidentally introduced a regression into 0.3.0. When
  calling `wasm-pack init`, if a directory was not passed, a user would receive
  a "Is a Directory" Error. Sorry about that! Thanks to [jbolila] for filing 
  [issue/136]!

- **typescript files were not included in published package - [danreeves], [pull/138]**

  Generating Typescript type files by default was a pretty rad feature in
  0.3.0 but we accidentally forgot to ensure they were included in the 
  published package. Thanks so much to [danreeves] for catching this issue 
  and fixing it for us!

[danreeves]: https://github.com/danreeves
[pull/138]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/138

## üí´ 0.3.0

### ‚ú® Features

- **Logging - [mgattozzi], [pull/134]**

  Up until now, we've forced folks to rely on emoji-jammed console output to debug
  errors. While emojis are fun, this is often not the most pleasant experience. Now
  we'll generate a `wasm-pack.log` file if `wasm-pack` errors on you, and you can
  customize the log verbosity using the (previously unimplemented) verbosity flag.

[pull/134]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/134

- **`--target` flag - [djfarly], [pull/132]**

  `wasm-bindgen-cli` is able to generate a JS module wrapper for generated wasm files
  for both ES6 modules and CommonJS. Up until now, we only used wasm-bindgen's default
  behavior, ES6 modules. You can now pass a `--target` flag with either `nodejs` or 
  `browser` to generate the type of module you want to use. Defaults to `browser` if not
  passed.

[djfarly]: https://github.com/djfarly
[pull/132]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/132

- **human readable panics - [yoshuawuyts], [pull/118]**

  Panics aren't always the most friendly situation ever. While we never want to panic on ya,
  if we do- we'll do it in a way that's a little more readable now.

[pull/118]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/118

- **typescript support by default - [kwonoj], [pull/109]**

  `wasm-bindgen` now generates typescript type files by default. To suppress generating
  the type file you can pass the `--no-typescript` flag. The type file is useful for more
  than just typescript folks- many IDEs use it for completion!

[kwonoj]: https://github.com/kwonoj
[pull/109]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/109

- **wrap `npm login` command - [djfarly], [pull/100]**

  In order to publish a package to npm, you need to be logged in. You can now use
  `wasm-pack login` to login to the npm (or any other) registry.

[pull/100]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/100

- **exit early on failure - [mgattozzi], [pull/90]**

  Until now, `wasm-pack` would continue to run tasks, even if a task failed. Now- if something
  fails, we'll exit so you don't have to wait to fix the error.

[pull/90]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/90

### ü§ï Fixes

- **force install wasm-bindgen - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/133]**

  Using an out of date version of `wasm-bindgen` can run you into a bunch of trouble. This
  very small change should fix the large number of bug reports we received from users using
  an out of date `wasm-bindgen-cli` by force installing `wasm-bindgen-cli` to ensure the user
  always has the latest version. We don't expect this to be a forever solution (it's a bit
  slow!) but it should help those who are getting started have a less rough time.

[pull/133]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/133

- **fix CI release builds - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/135]**

  This was not working! But now it is! You can always use `cargo install` to install
  wasm-pack, but now you can find pre-built Linux and Mac binaries in the [Releases]
  tab of our GitHub repo.

### üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance 

- **remove `quicli` dependency - [mgattozzi], [pull/131]**

  While `quicli` is a great way to get started writing a CLI app in Rust- it's not meant for 
  large, mature applications. Now that `wasm-pack` is bigger and has many active users, we've
  removed this dependency to unblock further development on the tool.

[pull/131]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/131

- **update rustfmt CI test - [djfarly], [pull/128]**

  Since 0.2.0 how one should call `rustfmt` changed! We've kept it up to date so we can continue
  to maintain conventional style in the codebase.

[pull/128]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/128

- **custom module for errors - [mgattozzi], [pull/120]**

  Thanks to the `failure` crate, we've been playing fast and loose with errors for a bit. We're
  finally getting serious about error handling - by organizing all of our specific errors in a
  specific module. This will make it easier to communicate these errors out and handle new error
  cases from future features.

[pull/120]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/120

### üìñ Documentation

Special thanks to [data-pup] who continues to be our documentation champion! In case you missed it,
check out the guides in the [docs directory!](docs)!

## üåå 0.2.0

This release focuses on filling out all commands and improving stderr/out
handling for improved user experience!

### ‚ú® Features

- **`pack` and `publish` - [jamiebuilds], [pull/67]**
  You can now run `wasm-pack pack` to generate a tarball of your generated package,
  as well as run `wasm-pack publish` to publish your package to the npm registry.
  Both commands require that you have npm installed, and the `publish` command requires
  that you be logged in to the npm client. We're working on wrapping the `npm login`
  command so that you can also login directly from `wasm-pack`, see [pull/100] for more
  details.

- **`package.json` is pretty printed now - [yoshuawuyts], [pull/70]**

  Previously, `package.json` was not very human readable. Now it is pretty printed!

- **`collaborators` - [yoshuawuyts], [pull/70]**

  `wasm-pack` now will fill out the `collaborators` field in your `package.json` for
  you based on your `Cargo.toml` `authors` data. For more discussion on how we decided
  on this v.s. other types of `author` fields in `package.json`, see [issues/2].
